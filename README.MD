This is a Java project that simulates the game "Where's My Water"

The project launches an interactive window visulizer for the game using Priceton CS libraries edu.princeton.cs.algs4.StdDraw

https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/code/

Under the hood, I implemented a Weighted Quick Union with virtual top and virtual bottom,

as well as block position hashing to speed up our UnionFind data structure.

The Game Launcher is WhereIsMyWater.java located in src folder
